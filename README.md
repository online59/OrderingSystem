# OrderingSystem

OrderingSystem is an application designed for both users and stores, facilitating inventory management and ordering processes. Users can conveniently place orders for desired items directly from suppliers, while administrators have the ability to manage inventories and perform administrative tasks.

## Features

1. **User Ordering**: Users can browse available inventories and place orders for items they wish to purchase directly from suppliers.

2. **Store Inventory Management**: Administrators (store owners or designated staff) can add new inventories, remove existing items, and manage the store's inventory efficiently.

3. **Cart Management**: Users can add items to their shopping cart for later review or remove items they no longer wish to purchase.

4. **Registration and Login**: The application includes registration and login features to allow users and administrators to access their respective accounts securely.

## Data Management

OrderingSystem utilizes Firebase Realtime Database for efficient data management. Firebase Realtime Database offers real-time synchronization and offline support, ensuring that data remains consistent across all devices and platforms.
